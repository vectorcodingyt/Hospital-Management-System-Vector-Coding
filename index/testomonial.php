                            <p class="fs-4 fw-normal">My experience at MEDINOVA was exceptional. Dr. David Patel and his team displayed incredible skill and compassion during my brain surgery. They took the time to address my concerns and provided clear explanations at every step. The post-operative care was outstanding, and the nursing staff was attentive and supportive. I am grateful to MEDINOVA for their expertise in neurosurgery and the positive impact they made on my life.</p>
